Method 1: invalid -- array parameter should be placed after "String"
public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}

Method 2: valid, but if you apply static modifier won't another method be unable to access it? so my guess is that you could only access this method from a non-main method.

public String myMethod() {
    return "Something";
}

Method 3: invalid, this should be "return x + y;" 

public static int addNumbers(int x, int y) {
   System.out.println(x + y);
}

Method 4: valid, but i think I have the same response as I did for Method 2. 

public double subtractNums(double x, double y, double z) {
    return "The answer is : " + (x + y + z);
}

Method 5: valid
public static printMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
}

Method 6: invalid, i think you need to give parameters to int() so that it can return values; also, return 5 + 5 won't do anything, I think

public static int() {
    return 5 + 5;
}

Method 7: invalid, you cannot return a short to an int without typeCasting

public static int value(short num1, short num2) {
    int answer = num1 * num2;
    return answer;
}
